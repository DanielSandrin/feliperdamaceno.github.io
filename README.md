This project was made in order to provide a portfolio webpage to my GitHub profile. In this project, I've created a responsive portfolio website, even on mobile/tablet or desktop. The technologies used to create this shiny website are HTML5 and CSS3.

You can modify, share and do whatever you want, All I ask for is an attribution ðŸ˜‰

## From me to you

Hi, my name is **Felipe!**

I'm a Front-End student who wants to share my learning with the community, helping other devs in the same situation.

At the moment I'm studying by myself in ðŸ’» online courses, ðŸ“„ reading the documentation, and ðŸ’ª hard practicing every day. So if I can, **you could too!**

I hope you've enjoyed this repository and have helped you in some way.

Thanks for checking out and have good learning ðŸ˜‰"
